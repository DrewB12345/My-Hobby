<h1>Video Games</h1>


<h2>How I got Started</h2>

<p>I have been playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game"> video games</a> my entire life, and it all started with my Gameboy Color and Nintendo 64. Since then, video games have been my main hobby. As I grew up, I continued to get the new systems as they came out. To this day, I still have most of my old games I played as I grew up.</p>

<h2>What I Like to Play</h2>

<p>Unlike the majority of gamers these days, I don’t really enjoy first person shooters like Call of Duty. Instead, I like to play other games, such as platformers, strategy games, and puzzle games. I don’t play Xbox or PlayStation very often. I prefer to play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo"> Nintendo</a> games.</p>

<p>I play new and old games, ranging from the ancient NES and Atari games to the Wii U. I believe that good graphics do not instantly make a game good. Therefore, I enjoy the older games as well as the newer games. The older consoles contain some of my favorite games.</p>

<h2>My Favorite</h2>

<p>Although there are games out there that I really like and games that I don’t like, I don’t have a favorite video game. I think that every game is different, and it’s just not possible to compare any two games. I either like or dislike a game. No matter how much I try to find out what my favorite is, I end up having a whole list of my favorites rather than just one specific game.</p>
